  ## Description

  This application is mimicking the backend structure of an e-commerce website. To be able to make the server, Express.js was installed, as well as MySQL to create the database that holds the seeds of this project, along with the help of Sequelize to be able to run the SQL models. In MySQL, all of the databases for each one of the products, categories, and tags can be contained in a series of tables. To be able to make requests to these tables, the use of RESTful API methods were used within the project files.
